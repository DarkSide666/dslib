Library of miscelanous ATK4 components made by Imants Horsts (aka DarkSide).

COMPONENTS
---------
 1)	Advanced search form for Grid.
	Example with Grid:
		$g = $page->add('dslib/Grid_Extended');
		$g->setModel('Example');
		$g->addAdvancedSearch(array('name','salary','is_active','notes'));
	Example with CRUD:
		You can use this with CRUD->grid too, but then you have to extend default CRUD class like this:
		class MyCRUD extends CRUD{
			public $grid_class='dslib/Grid_Extended';
		}
	Known problems:
		- Not working well together with paginator (quickSearch doesn't do that either).
		- If you submit your search form by pressing Enter, then isClicked=false and submitted() method don't memorize token.
		
 2)	New form field - Form_Field_Chooser or simply Chooser
		... in development ...
