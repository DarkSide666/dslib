xLibrary of miscelanous ATK4 components made by Imants Horsts (aka DarkSide).

COMPONENTS
----------
 1)	Extended search form for Grid.
	
	Example with Grid:
		$g = $page->add('dslib/Grid_Extended');
		$g->setModel('Example');
		$g->addExtendedSearch(array('name','salary','is_active','notes'));
	
	Example with CRUD:
		You can use this extended grid with CRUD too:
		$page->add('dslib/CRUD_Extended');
	
	Known problems:
		- Not working well together with paginator (quickSearch doesn't do that
		  either).
		- If you submit your search form by pressing Enter, then isClicked=false
		  and submitted() method don't memorize token.
		- If you have checkbox in your adv.search form and don't check it, then
		  it's not sent to server on submit and as result is not taken into account
		  at all in data filtering query. For example, if you have field "is_active"
		  and you try to filter all records where is_active=false or 0.
		
 2)	New form field - Form_Field_Chooser or simply Chooser
	
		... in development ...
